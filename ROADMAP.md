# Roadmap

## Near-term

- Metadata enrichment for videos (YouTube oEmbed for title/thumbnail)
- Export/import training plans (JSON)
- Basic share link (serialize plan to URL param)
- Minimal UI polish (toasts, validations)

## Medium-term

- Optional backend with Prisma + SQLite (or Postgres)
- Auth (Clerk/NextAuth) and per-user data
- Drag-and-drop reordering in Plan Builder

## Later ideas

- Exercise templates with parameters (reps, time, equipment)
- Plan duplication and versioning
- Print/export to PDF
